# Linting Example

Uses [`@codemirror/lint`](https://github.com/codemirror/lint) and `@codemirror/lang-javascript`'s `esLint` to provide diagnostics as the user types. It uses [`eslint4b`](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint4b) to lint in the browser.

Note that if you are not using a bundler, you should use [`eslint4b-prebuilt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint4b-prebuilt).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
